    <p><b>Why is e-learning important?</b><br>
        E-learning methods and technology are important both for educating students 
        and for the professional development of employees in the workforce.
        The rapid evolution of technology has made it increasingly important for 
        employees to have the right skills and training. In addition, companies are
         increasingly turning to online learning for ongoing training and upskilling
          employees. Learning management systems (LMSes) are particularly popular in 
          corporate settings. <i><b>Higher education institutions also use online learning methods along with 
          internet-capable electronic devices, both inside and outside of traditional classrooms</i></b>.According 
          to McKinsey & Company's 2022 survey of 7,000 students in 17 countries, 65% of higher education 
          students want schools to retain aspects of online learning in the post-pandemic world.Online education is delivered 
          using a combination of static and interactive methods. Static approaches include learning portals, hyperlinked pages, screen cam
           tutorials, streamed audio and video and live web broadcasts. Interactive methods are approaches such as discussion forums, chats and desktop video conferencing.</p>
